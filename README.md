# AmazonClone
The Amazon clone project is a replica of the Amazon website, focusing on its frontend design. Built using HTML and CSS, it aims to recreate the visual layout and user interface of the original site. This project highlights core web development skills in structuring pages and styling them to resemble the familiar Amazon look and feel.
